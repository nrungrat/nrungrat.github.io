I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.bme.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Biomedical Engineering</a> at Columbia University (starting 1 July, 2024). My research group focuses on integrating computational and experimental approaches to investigate the neural computations underlying complex cognitive functions in both health and disease.


I completed my BA in Neuroscience and Mathematics at Middlebury College, VT in 2014 and received my PhD in Neurosciences from University of California, San Diego in 2020. During my graduate studies, under the guidance of <a href="https://serenceslab.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. John Serences</a> and <a href="http://whoville.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Larry Squire</a>, I used a complementary blend of novel psychophysical paradigms, neuroimaging techniques, and lesion studies to gain insights into how the brain encodes and utilizes probabilistic sensory information for adaptive decision making. Prior to joining Columbia, I was a Swartz Theoretical Neuroscience Fellow in the lab of <a href="https://cnl.salk.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Terry Sejnowski</a> at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where I investigated the neural underpinnings of flexible information processing using biologically-inspired deep learning models. In addition, I was a visiting Postdoctoral Scientist in the lab of <a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/research/labs/rutishauser.html" target="_blank">Dr. Ueli Rutishauser</a> at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where I studied the neural correlates of contextual information processing. I was also an Inaugural Provost's Research Fellow as part of the Inclusive Faculty Pathways Initiative at Columbia University.
