I am a graduate student in Applied Physics at California Institute of Technology working in <a href="http://www.bellanplasmagroup.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Bellan Plasma Group</a>. 
My research interests are plasma physics, spheromaks, solar physics, and plasma instabilities. I study these topics with pulse-power
laboratory experiment and MHD numerical simulation.
