I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.bme.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Biomedical Engineering</a> at Columbia University. My research group focuses on integrating computational and experimental approaches to investigate the neural computations underlying complex cognitive functions in both health and disease.
