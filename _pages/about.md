I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in <a href="https://positrons.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Surko Positron Research group</a>. My current project involves studying 2D vortex dynamics under time-dependent strain using columnar electron plasma.

I did my PhD. in Applied Physics at California Institute of Technology working in <a href="http://www.bellanplasmagroup.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Bellan Plasma Group</a>. My research interests include plasma physics, spheromaks, solar physics, and plasma instabilities. I study these topics with pulse-power laboratory experiment and MHD numerical simulation.
