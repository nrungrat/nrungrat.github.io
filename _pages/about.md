Nuttida is a postdoctoal research fellow in (<a href="https://cnl.salk.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Terry Sejnowski</a>'s Computational Neurobiology lab at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. Her work focuses on developing experimental and computational frameworks to investigate the neural computations that underlie complex cognitive functions in health and disease. In collaboration with <a href="https://www.arl.army.mil/who-we-are/directorates/hred/" target="_blank">HRED, CCDC US Army Research Lab </a>, Nuttida also examines the neural dynamics associated with heterogeneity in seizure evolution.  

Nuttida received her BA in Neuroscience and Mathematics from Middlebury College, VT in 2014 and her PhD in Neurosciences with a Specialization in Computational Neurosciences from University of California, San Diego in 2020. Her graduate work with <a href="https://serenceslab.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. John Serences</a> and <a href="http://whoville.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Larry Squire</a> employs a complementary blend of novel psychophysical paradigms, neuroimaging techniques, and lesion studies to understand the mechanisms by which the brain encodes and uses probabilistic sensory information to guide adaptive decision choices.
