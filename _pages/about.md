I am a Provost's research fellow as part of the inagural Inclusive Faculty Pathways Initiative at Columbia University. My research group locates in the department of Biomedical Engineering (BME) and focuses on combining computational with experimental techniques to investigate the neural computations that underlie complex cognitive functions in health and disease. 

I received my BA in Neuroscience and Mathematics from Middlebury College, VT in 2014 and my PhD in Neurosciences from University of California, San Diego in 2020. My graduate work with <a href="https://serenceslab.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. John Serences</a> and <a href="http://whoville.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Larry Squire</a> uses a complementary blend of novel psychophysical paradigms, neuroimaging techniques, and lesion studies to understand the mechanisms by which the brain encodes and uses probabilistic sensory information to guide adaptive decision making. Before joining Columbia BME, I was a Swartz fellow in the lab of <a href="https://cnl.salk.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Terry Sejnowski</a> at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies where I worked on studied the neural bases of flexbible information processing through biologically inspired deep learning models.
