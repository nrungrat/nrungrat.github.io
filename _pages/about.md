I am a Provost's Research Fellow as part of the inaugural Inclusive Faculty Pathways Initiative at Columbia University. My research group is located in the Department of Biomedical Engineering (BME) and focuses on integrating computational and experimental approaches to investigate the neural computations underlying complex cognitive functions in both health and disease.

I completed my BA in Neuroscience and Mathematics at Middlebury College, VT in 2014 and obtained my PhD in Neurosciences from University of California, San Diego in 2020. During my graduate studies, under the guidance of <a href="https://serenceslab.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. John Serences</a> and <a href="http://whoville.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Larry Squire</a>, I used a complementary blend of novel psychophysical paradigms, neuroimaging techniques, and lesion studies to gain insights into how the brain encodes and utilizes probabilistic sensory information for adaptive decision making. Prior to joining Columbia BME, I held the position of Swartz fellow in the lab of <a href="https://cnl.salk.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Terry Sejnowski</a> at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where I investigated the neural underpinnings of flexible information processing using biologically-inspired deep learning models.
