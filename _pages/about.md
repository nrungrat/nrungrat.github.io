I am a postdoctoal research fellow working jointly with Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, <a href="https://cnl.salk.edu/" target="_blank">Computational Neurobiology Laboratory, the Salk Institute for Biological Studies</a> and <a href="https://www.arl.army.mil/who-we-are/directorates/hred/" target="_blank">HRED, CCDC US Army Research Laborator</a>. 

{% I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in <a href="https://positrons.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Surko Positron Research group</a>. My current project involves studying 2D vortex dynamics under time-dependent strain using columnar electron plasma. 

I did my Ph.D. in Applied Physics at California Institute of Technology working in <a href="http://www.bellanplasmagroup.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Bellan Plasma Group</a>. My research interests include plasma physics, spheromaks, solar physics, and plasma instabilities. I study these topics with pulse-power laboratory experiment and MHD numerical simulation. %}
