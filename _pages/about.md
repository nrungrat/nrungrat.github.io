I am a graduate student in Applied Physics at California Institute of Technology working in [Bellan Plasma Group](http://www.bellanplasmagroup.caltech.edu/ "Bellan Plasma Group"). 
My areas of interest span Plasma Physics, Spheromaks, Solar Physics, and Plasma Instabilities. I study these topics with 
laboratory experiment and numerical simulation.
