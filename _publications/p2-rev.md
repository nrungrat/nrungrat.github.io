excerpt: 'We reported a new model for explaining the three-part structure of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We proposed that the cavity was formed 
due to a diamagnetic effect of the plasma in ideal MHD regime. The dynamics of the obeservational, experimental, and simulated flux rope is tested with 
a simple 1D equation of motion.'
