title: "A Tellurium Frequency Reference For Re-pumping During Laser-cooling of Strontium"
collection: research
authors: <b>Pakorn Wongwaitayakornkul</b> and Thomas Killian
excerpt: 'I worked on the development of a new repumping system for laser-cooled strontium atoms using a laser operating at 481 nm. 
The project includes characterization of the new laser, construction of the temperature control system, and the spectroscopy of the 
tellurium cell.'
